PNGTube-Remix!
Start PNGTubing in a more interesting and alive way.
This software is currently in its Alpha stages. However, it is usable!
This version of PNGTuber+ is made for the purpose of improving the old source code (being fully remade from scratch with optimization in mind), adding new features and more.
Due to being remade from scratch, some features aren't 1:1 from the og source, yet. Since it is still being worked on, but expect things to be reimplemented soon!

The UI had been remade to be much easier to understand. A document will be made when the first full release is out. 
An in-app doc will be added too, tho.. not as complex, more of a heads up!
